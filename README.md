# 💻 QR Code Component | Frontend Mentor

## 📖 Description

This little site was made with *HTML* and *CSS*. The objective was to replicate the design provided by *Frontend Mentor* website. Since the sketch and Figma files are premium only, I used the images and Style Guide provided to make it.

I usually use *flexbox* to center stuff, but since this project is very simple, I wanted to do it in a different way, so I tried to remember how I've done it in the past. Gladly, I remembered it:

```css
left: 50%;
position: absolute;
transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
top: 50%;
```

In this case, I used the `position` property as `absolute`, moved the container to the center of the screen with `left: 50%` and `top: 50%`, and "removed" the remaining space with `translate(-50%, -50%)`. This is only one of the many ways of centering a container.
